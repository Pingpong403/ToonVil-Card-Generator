-Exports is where your assembled cards will come out once you run the generator.

--TROUBLESHOOTING--
"There's a black background where the image should be": this happens when card can't find a suitable image in -Images. Either 1) the image is missing, 2) the image isn't in the right format (it needs to be .png, .jpg, or .jpeg), or 3) the image has disallowed punctuation at the end.
"Words in the text area are cut off or missing": bolded words are measured as regular words, meaning they are given less space than they need on their line. This can cause other words to be cut off at the end of a line. To avoid this, add a new line character before the word that is being cut off.
"One or more of my cards is missing": the generator will ignore entries in Cards.txt that do not have all the necessary fields. If the title, ability, or type is missing, the card will not be generated. Make sure every field is included, leaving unused fields blank.
