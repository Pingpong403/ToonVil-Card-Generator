# AI Usage

I plan to use AI to help me build this project. AI will not be making any design choices for me. Its only purpose here is to find answers that I would otherwise have to scour the Web for.

Here is a list documenting every time I have asked AI a question and how it impacted the final product:

- starting a .NET project
- using System.Drawing to generate a PNG
- using Path to build a proper filepath for intermediary text images
- creating a FontLoader helper class
- using "using" correctly
- creating more proper filepaths
- getting center alignment for the text
- reducing padding for the text
- fixing error with float division
- saving resized image, not original, to ImageIntermediary
- found why files were being used when trying to delete
