Config files are how you change the settings of the generator without coding.
The generator looks here for a lot of the values, files, symbols, and settings it uses.

asset-config: anything to do with assets and how the generator handles them
card-config: card dimensions, text area sizes, and image area height
color-config: any color that is standard across this system
layout-config: element positioning
text-config: data concerning how text is drawn and which formatting symbols will be used
